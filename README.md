Website-Online by Bilawal Hameed
==============

A basic PHP script that shows whether a website is online.

See a demo (http://bilaw.al/code/websiteonline/1.0/)[here].

I built it in 2008 as a side project, but I never did anything with it. I saw it on my PC, and thought it deserved some open source goodness. It's a very simple script built in PHP (no database required). Enjoy it! :-)
